Roundcube skin by Tecorama (http://roundcubeskins.net)
======================================================

This Roundcube skin works on both desktop and mobile browsers. In order to enable the automatic skin mode switching
depending on the device being used to browse the mail and to make the skin compatible with some third party
plugins that don't support skining, you should enable the included rcs_skins plugin.

Roundcube compatibility
-----------------------

The skin is compatible with Roundcube 0.9 and 1.0. It will not work with earlier versions of Roundcube.

Browser compatibility
---------------------

The skin is compatible with all modern browsers.

Installation
------------

1. Install the skin:

Copy the skin directory to the "skins" folder of your Roundcube installation.

2. Install the rcs_skins plugin and some additional plugin files:

Copy the contents of the "plugins" directory from the installation package to the "plugins" directory of your Roundcube.

3. Set the skin as default:

Edit the file "config/config.inc.php" and set the 'skin' variable this way:

$config['skin'] = 'skin_name';

(Replace 'skin_name' with the name of the skin you're installing.)

4. Enable the rcs_skins plugin:

Find the variable 'plugins' in the file "config/config.inc.php" and add rcs_skins to the array, like this:

$config['plugins'] = array("rcs_skins");

(If you're using Roundcube 0.9, the config file will be called "config/main.inc.php" and the plugins variable will be
called "$rcmail_config['plugins']".)
